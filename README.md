# Unread Notifications for Bluesky (Chrome Extension)

Display unread notification badges for Bluesky!

Bluesky web app doesn't immediately show the unread notification count so this extension adds a little badge to the extension icon, as well as to the tab icon (can be turned off).

The extension's popup shows a summary of unread Bluesky notifications and an option to quickly mark them all as read.
